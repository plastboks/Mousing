Mousing
=======
Mousing is a microscopic Linux program for tracking mouse movement (scrolling included?), and output to terminal and log to database.

About
=====
The main reason for this program was to learn to reduce heavy mouse use. 
One way to do this is to get some numbers and comparing them on a daily basis.

Compiling
=========
Compiling this program is simply done by: `make`.

Install
==========
No global install routines have been made at this point. After the `make` run, a binary 'mousing' is created in the root folder of this project. Move binary to wanted destination.
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies as listed below.

Dependencies
=====
  * ncurses
  * X11
  * sqlite
  * libconfig

Branches
========
In the beginning of the project things were so little and experimental, so there was no need for multiple branches.
The develop branch (default), will be a feature and develop branch pushing this project forward. The develop branch might be in a none-compiling state at times.
I will strive to make sure the master branch will be stable at all times.
