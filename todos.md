Mousing Todos
=============
* Track scrolling use ?
    * This seems to need another X11 library ... ?
* Clean up code (refactor), and merge variables into arrays etc.
    * Try to find the best datastorage 'structure' for the main mouse properties.
        * Use structs ? 
        * Use arrays ?

Known bugs
==========
* After introduction the help and stats page, there has been some incidents where bleeding between screens has occurred. Might consider doing a better sweep/clean between screen switches.

Mousing Future Tech
===================
  * Export data and generate some pretty graphs/plots.
  * Make better use of ncurses with centered information, and panels (date, help, menus).
